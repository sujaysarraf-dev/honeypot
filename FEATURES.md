- ✅ Session recording with timestamps
- ✅ Supports password and public key authentication
- ✅ Realistic shell simulation

#### HTTP Honeypot
- ✅ Multiple fake endpoints (admin, login, API, etc.)
- ✅ Logs all HTTP requests (method, path, headers, body)
- ✅ Captures user agents and referrers
- ✅ Simulates common web application endpoints
- ✅ JSON session recording

#### Database API Honeypot
- ✅ PostgreSQL protocol simulation (port 5432)
- ✅ MySQL protocol simulation (port 3306)
- ✅ Logs connection attempts

- ✅ Directory operation tracking

### 2. Comprehensive Monitoring

#### Packet Capture
- ✅ Full network packet capture (PCAP format)
- ✅ Automatic file rotation (100MB per file)
- ✅ Retains last 10 capture files
- ✅ Uses tcpdump for reliable capture
- ✅ Timestamped capture files

#### Log Aggregation
- ✅ Real-time log aggregation from all services
- ✅ Unified log format (JSON)
- ✅ File system watching for new logs
- ✅ Automatic log rotation
- ✅ Source tracking for each log entry

#### Session Recording
- ✅ Complete session recordings in JSON format
- ✅ Timestamped events
- ✅ Command history
- ✅ Authentication attempts
- ✅ Client IP tracking
- ✅ Session metadata

### 3. IOC Detection & Alerting

#### IOC Detection Patterns
- ✅ SQL Injection detection
- ✅ Command Injection detection
- ✅ Path Traversal detection
- ✅ XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) detection
- ✅ Malicious command detection
- ✅ Credential harvesting detection

#### Alerting Channels
- ✅ Generic webhook support
- ✅ Slack integration
- ✅ Telegram bot integration
- ✅ Configurable alert thresholds
- ✅ Rich alert messages with context

### 4. Security & Isolation

#### Network Isolation
- ✅ Isolated Docker network
- ✅ No egress from honeypot services
- ✅ Controlled egress for alerting only
- ✅ Host network mode for IOC detector (alerting)

#### Safety Features
- ✅ No real exploits or vulnerabilities
- ✅ All services are simulated
- ✅ No execution of untrusted code
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for forensics
- ✅ Legal and ethical use documentation

### 5. Data Collection & Storage

#### Data Types Collected
- ✅ Packet captures (PCAP)
- ✅ Service logs
- ✅ Session recordings (JSON)
- ✅ Detected IOCs (JSON)
- ✅ Aggregated logs

#### Storage Organization
- ✅ Organized by service type
- ✅ Timestamped files
- ✅ Easy to analyze and export
- ✅ Persistent storage via volumes

## Technical Features

### Containerization
- ✅ Docker Compose orchestration
- ✅ Individual service containers
- ✅ Volume mounts for data persistence
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Health monitoring

### Scalability
- ✅ Multi-threaded service handling
- ✅ Concurrent connection support
- ✅ Resource-efficient design
- ✅ Configurable limits

### Observability
- ✅ Structured logging
- ✅ Log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- ✅ Service-specific log files
- ✅ Centralized log aggregation
- ✅ Real-time monitoring

## Use Cases

### 1. Security Research
- Study attack patterns and techniques
- Analyze attacker behavior
- Research threat intelligence
- Academic security research

### 2. Threat Intelligence
- Collect indicators of compromise
- Monitor for new attack vectors
- Track attacker infrastructure
- Build threat intelligence databases

### 3. Security Training
- Security awareness training
- Red team exercises
- Penetration testing practice
- Incident response training

### 4. Network Monitoring
- Detect unauthorized access attempts
- Monitor network perimeter
- Identify suspicious activity
- Early threat detection

## Limitations & Considerations

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ Protocol simulations are simplified (not full implementations)
- ⚠️ Some advanced protocol features may not be supported
- ⚠️ Performance may degrade under heavy load
- ⚠️ Requires sufficient disk space for logs and PCAPs

### Best Practices
- ✅ Deploy in isolated environments only
- ✅ Monitor disk usage regularly
- ✅ Rotate logs and PCAPs periodically
- ✅ Review alerts regularly
- ✅ Keep Docker and system updated
- ✅ Use strong authentication for alerting endpoints
